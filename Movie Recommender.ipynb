    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In todays on demand world, one of the most beneficial uses of a recommender system is suggesting which movie or TV show a user would be interested in watching. Netflix uses user history to recommend what people should watch next, but before a user builds up a substantial history one would guess that seen a preview of the show or at least read the plot to make sure theyâ€™ll enjoy what they want to watch. Kaggle has a list of around 35k movies and their plots that can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots. In this project I will take a sample of the movies in this CSV by filter to just movies created after 2008 and use their plots to make movie recommendations based on the plot of the movies a user likes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data \n",
    "The Kaggle data has movie data dating back to 1901 with other fields such as the movie's wikipedia page and country of origin. For the purpose of this project we'll filter the data to only include movies from after 2008 and only get the movie's title, release year, director, genre, and plot. This data will provide us with enough to see what kind of recommendations we can get with certrain inputs. \n"

    "Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency or TF-IDF is one of the most popular algorithms in text processing. The idea behind TF-IDF is that the algorithm will take the documents, in our case the documents are movie plots, and score how important each word in it is. It does this by looking at each unique word in the documents and then seeing how frquently that word is used in each document. The TF-IDF scores for words can then be made into vectors for each document that can then be used to create a matrix of scores. For our movie plots we can use the Python library scikit-learn's TfIdfVectorizer class that will produces the TF-IDF matrix for us. "

       "\"Kate Holbrook (Tina Fey) is a successful single businesswoman who has always put her career before her personal life. Now in her late thirties, she finally decides to have her own child, but her plans are dampened when she discovers she has a minuscule chance of becoming pregnant because her uterus is T-shaped. Also denied the chance to adopt, Kate hires an immature, obnoxious, South Philly woman named Angie Ostrowski (Amy Poehler) to become her surrogate mother.\\r\\nWhen Angie becomes pregnant, Kate prepares for motherhood in her own typically driven fashionâ€”until her surrogate shows up at her door with no place to live. Their conflicting personalities put them at odds as Kate learns first-hand about balancing motherhood and career and also dates the owner of a local blended-juice cafe, Rob Ackerman (Greg Kinnear).\\r\\nUnknown to Kate, the in-vitro fertilization procedure Angie had did not succeed and she is feigning the pregnancy, hoping to ultimately run off with her payment. Eventually she starts to regret lying about not being pregnant, but she continually puts off confessing. When she gets an ultrasound, she discovers she is pregnant for real. Realizing the baby is her own (with her common-law husband Carl (Dax Shepard), from whom she is separated), Angie is forced to confess at Kate's baby shower. When Kate explains to Angie that the pregnancy test was supposed to be taken two weeks after the procedure, and that the baby could still belong to her, a wedge is driven between the two women.\\r\\nA court hearing determines that the baby is Angie's, and Angie makes an impassioned apology to Kate. As the women meet face-to-face after the proceedings, Angie's water breaks and Kate rushes her to the hospital, then passes out during the birth. As she wakes up, the doctor supervising Angie's pregnancy tells Kate that she's two months pregnant (the result of her relationship with her new boyfriend). After receiving the news, she visits Angie, who is holding her new baby daughter Stef, named for Gwen Stefani. Kate forgives Angie and the two become best friends, ultimately changing each other for the better.\\r\\nAngie and Kate raise their children and are in a sister-like relationship one year later at Stef's first-birthday party. It is revealed that Kate and Rob are very proud parents of a baby daughter and are engaged. Although he does not reunite with Angie, Carl stays close to his daughter and takes parenting classes. The final scene shows Angie and Kate sitting in front of a television set with their children, watching Tom and Jerry cartoons, a reference to an earlier line in the film.\""

Asked by a student if she is pregnant, she pretends she is, then continues the lie to the school principal, Mrs. Barnes (Megan Mullally). Her co-worker Dave (Nick Offerman) reveals that he knows she has been drinking and she makes him swear not to tell anyone.\\r\\nAttending a party with her husband Charlie (Aaron Paul) and his brother Owen (Kyle Gallner), Kate drinks heavily. While leaving, she meets a woman who asks Kate for a ride. Kate is offered crack and the two get high together. The next morning, Kate wakes alone on the street. She finds her car and drives home, where Charlie acknowledges they both are alcoholics. They get intoxicated and have sex before Charlie passes out. Kate heads out alone to buy wine but is turned down by the cashier. She urinates on the floor because the bathroom door is locked, then steals a bottle of wine.\\r\\nWaking up, Kate realizes she has passed out again. At work, Dave, a recovering alcoholic, invites her to an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting. There, she befriends Jenny (Octavia Spencer), who has chosen a passion for food and cooking over alcohol. Kate decides to become sober and change her life. Dave drives Kate home, but bluntly makes an offensive comment which upsets her. When Kate and Charlie visit her estranged alcoholic mother, Rochelle (Mary Kay Place), Kate mentions the AA meetings but Rochelle is skeptical; Kate\\'s father left them after getting sober and now lives in another state with his \"shiny new family\".\\r\\nKate is surprised the next day when she is thrown a baby shower by her colleagues. She reconciles with Dave, putting his comments behind them. At home, Kate is angry when it becomes clear Charlie told Owen and his friend about Kate smoking crack. That night, she rebuffs Charlie\\'s sexual advances. At school, Kate is questioned by a curious student as to why she is not gaining weight. She subsequently feigns a miscarriage and her students accuse her of killing her baby, for which she reprimands them.\\r\\nKate tells Charlie she feels she must confess to Mrs. Barnes the truth about her faked pregnancy. Charlie discourages her, warning that she will lose her job, and they begin to fight over financial issues. Kate lashes back that she would never depend on Charlie\\'s parents\\' money and that she has struggled her whole life. Kate decides to tell Mrs. Barnes the truth and is fired. In a bar, she relapses. Jenny and Dave drive her home, where she starts an altercation with Charlie.\\r\\nAfter some time, Kate speaks at an AA meeting, celebrating one year of sobriety, while Charlie gets in trouble for riding a bicycle while drunk. Kate visits Charlie and they play croquet. Charlie asks if she would move back in with him if he begins going to AA meetings. Kate says he must get sober for himself, not for her. Charlie then asks Kate to play another round, to give him a chance to redeem himself. The film ends before Kate gives her answer.'"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Using TF-IDF made getting scores for the words in the plots straightforward. We were able to use those scores to see which plots used those words the most and make assumptions that those plots would be similar. In the case of Baby Mama and Smashed I think the user would have been pleased with the choice they got. Smashed is a comedy centered around people making better life choices while Baby Mama is a comedy about people learning from each other to have better lives. In the case of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, I'm pretty sure if the user chose to watch that theywould probably choose to watch the first one but I also think they would've liked to know that Spider-Man: Homecoming was available as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender system could use improvements by taking in more than just the frequency of words in the plot or the titles. Maybe adding in sentiment of the movie, reviews, or directors/ actors would make the recommendations more spot on. However, I'm pleased that the system did as well as it did with just 4,000 movies to chose from. "
